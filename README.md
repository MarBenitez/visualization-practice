# Data Visualization Practice

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my skills in data visualization using __Plotly, Matplotlib and Seaborn__. I have created various plots and graphs to help understand and visualize a salarie dataset effectively in this [notebook](https://github.com/MarBenitez/visualization-practice/blob/main/plotly_practice.ipynb).


## Introduction

This dataset is useful for understanding the distribution of salaries in the data science field and how these can vary based on factors such as employee and employer location, level of experience, type of employment, among others. It allows us to explore the impact of remote work on data science salaries and draw insightful conclusions.

## Objective

The main objective of this exercise is to learn and apply data analysis and visualization techniques using the Python libraries Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Steps to Complete the Analysis

1. **Explore the Dataset**: Understand the structure of the dataset, the types of variables present, and how they are distributed.
2. **Clean and Prepare the Dataset**: Manipulate the data to make it more accessible and useful for analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and generating new variables.
3. **Analyze the Dataset**: Extract useful and meaningful information from the dataset through various data analysis techniques.
4. **Visualize Data**: Create graphs and diagrams that help understand and communicate the patterns and relationships present in the data.

## Tools and Libraries

To achieve these goals, the following libraries are used:

- **Matplotlib**: For creating basic plots such as bar, line, and scatter plots.
- **Seaborn**: For creating more complex and visually appealing graphics, leveraging its integration with pandas.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive graphs that allow deeper exploration of the data.

## Installation

To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
